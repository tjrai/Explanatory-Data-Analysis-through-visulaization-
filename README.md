================================================
The data is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for 
machine learning datasets. 
Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over
a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.


The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. 
Only data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02 are used. 
Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.
